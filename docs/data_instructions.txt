Accessing Data: 
==============

You can now easily access the two datasets using either R or Matlab: 

1. Video Data

R:
==
Data is available in 103 separate files with names: data\Video\Charlie Chaplin - The Lions Cage_X

If you want to read one of the Video data files to R all you need to do is use the function
readRDS("filename"). (don't use here the mat files, but the R files).

Example:
file.name = C:/Users/username/Desktop/course52311/data/Video/Charlie Chaplin - The Lions Cage_1" 
vid_data_1 = readRDS(file.name)
names(vid_data_1).

Matlab: 
=======
Data is available in 103 separate files with names: data\Video\Charlie Chaplin - The Lions Cage_X.mat
for X from 1 to 103. Loading each will give you a 3-dim. array called VideoDataIntensity_3D with 50 consecutive frames. 
Each element represents the intensity of a certain pixel at a certain frame. 


2. Gene Expression Data

R:
==
The function dataExample.R can be used to read the data from the file: 'AllSamples.rpkm.gct' and annotations 
from the file: 'GTEx_Analysis_Annotations_Sample_DS__Pilot_V3.txt'.
The expression matrix (representing a 3dim array) is in the variable 'express'. 
Each row represents a gene. Each column represents an (tissue,individual) pair. 
For each column the tissue and individual ids are given by the vectors: tissue_ids, individual_ids. 
You can get the expression matrix for a specific tissue using the function: makeTissueExpressionSet
You can get for two tissues the set of individuals which have expression for both using the function: intersectExpressionTablesOnSubjects


Matlab: 
=======
You can download the entire data by running the script 'Read_GTEx_Dataset'. It will give you a 3-dimensional 
array. The data is available in the following two .mat files (data was separated to two files becaues together they were too large for uploading to github):  
AllSamples.rpkm_3D.mat (indices and labels), 
AllSamples.rpkm_3D_values.mat (expression values) 



Note that the dataset available is pretty sparse. only for ~37% of (tissueXindividual) combination there is data. 
You can look at the figure at data/GTEx/IndividualByTissueDataAvailability.jpg to see which datasets are available. 
This situation of missing data is pretty common in real datasets. 
One interesting project would be to try to predict the missing data (this is often called 'imputation'). 
Another, easier option, is to perform the analysis only on a subset of tissues and individuals, such that for 
this subset the data is complete. (there are ~8-9 tissues which were measured for most individuals).
